  let‚Äôs run nmap and check what ports are open

  I discovered 2 open ports: 22 and 80,. Since port 80 is open, let‚Äôs check the website.

It is just a normal high school website.




So let‚Äôs check for any other hidden directories using dirsearch.

I found that there is a hidden directory (/assets). Let‚Äôs check /assets.




  ![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(199).png)

  

The directory is simply a blank page. Let‚Äôs proceed further by finding the subdirectory.

Let‚Äôs begin the command injection

 Oh, I got the base64. Let‚Äôs crack it using cyberchef.

 since the command injection works this is a clear picture of a reverse shell lets do that without wasting anytime.
 

 Go to https://www.revshells.com/ and generate the reverse shell as below.

Click on copy and then paste it into the URL after cmd =

make sure to enter your machine ip not the eth0 but tun0 for tryhackme and port save as of listener



on the attacker machine means our machine we have to start a listener



                                                    nc -lvnp 4444
                                                    

 
  ![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(205).png)

  

 Wow, I received the connection.

 

  
  ![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(207).png)

  

Run command: python3 -c ‚Äòimport pty;pty.spawn(‚Äú/bin/bash‚Äù)‚Äô to use /bin/bash



Inside the images directory, there are 2 images.



Let‚Äôs Transfer these files from the Victim‚Äôs machine to the attacker‚Äôs system using Netcat.

when you recieve the connection on listener side simply close the connection by ctrl+c and verify using ls command


you must have oneforall.jpg.look in the same directory in which you were listening


upon further inspection found that the file uses the extension .jpg but is in data format. So we are going to Change the 

incorrect jpg file headers.



Opening the file using Hexedit. Command: hexedit oneforall.jpg



  
![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(210).png)

  

Change the initial header to FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01 01 00 00 01. This is the correct signature for the jpeg 


file. Save the file.



![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(211).png)

    

Now it is showing the correct extension for the image and I can also view the image.



 ![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(212).png)

    

Now using this file we can use stegnography to check file contents Using steghide to extract the files inside the file



                                    steghide extract -sf oneforall.jpg

                                    

its going to ask for a passphrase



![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(213).png)

    

after decoding it in base64 we know that the passphrase is AllmightForEver!!!



![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(214).png)

    

 wow, finally I got the password for Deku.
 

Using the password that I got, I can easily log in to Duke using ssh.

![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(216).png)

    

  we have got our first flag




  ## Privilege Escalation ##

  

i am going to keep this straight forward.Inthe shell access i found that deku was only allowed restricted access

he could only access /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh and it is a form



 ![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(217).png)

 

Deku can give feedback. Let‚Äôs try to give malicious feedback. The malicious feedback is ‚ÄòDeku ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL ¬ª /etc/sudoers‚Äô

![hg1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(218).png)

It works and now I got the root access.
