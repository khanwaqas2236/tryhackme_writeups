  ## Reconnaissance ##
  let‚Äôs run nmap and check what ports are open
  
  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

  I discovered 2 open ports: 22 and 80,. Since port 80 is open, let‚Äôs check the website.

It is just a normal high school website.

So let‚Äôs check for any other hidden directories using dirsearch.

I found that there is a hidden directory (/assets). Let‚Äôs check /assets.

![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

The directory is simply a blank page. Let‚Äôs proceed further by finding the subdirectory.

Let‚Äôs begin the command injection

![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

 Oh, I got the base64. Let‚Äôs crack it using cyberchef.

 ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

 since the command injection works this is a clear picture of a reverse shell lets do that without wasting anytime.

 Go to https://www.revshells.com/ and generate the reverse shell as below.

Click on copy and then paste it into the URL after cmd =

make sure to enter your machine ip not the eth0 but tun0 for tryhackme and port save as of listener

on the attacker machine means our machine we have to start a listener

                                                    nc -lvnp 4444

 ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

 Wow, I received the connection.

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

Run command: python3 -c ‚Äòimport pty;pty.spawn(‚Äú/bin/bash‚Äù)‚Äô to use /bin/bash

Inside the images directory, there are 2 images.

Let‚Äôs Transfer these files from the Victim‚Äôs machine to the attacker‚Äôs system using Netcat.

when you recieve the connection on listener side simply close the connection by ctrl+c and verify using ls command

you must have oneforall.jpg.look in the same directory in which you were listening

upon further inspection found that the file uses the extension .jpg but is in data format. So we are going to Change the incorrect jpg file headers.

Opening the file using Hexedit. Command: hexedit oneforall.jpg

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

Change the initial header to FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01 01 00 00 01. This is the correct signature for the jpeg file. Save the file.

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

Now it is showing the correct extension for the image and I can also view the image.

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

Now using this file we can use stegnography to check file contents Using steghide to extract the files inside the file

                                    steghide extract -sf oneforall.jpg

its going to ask for a passphrase

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

after decoding it in base64 we know that the passphrase is AllmightForEver!!!

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

 wow, finally I got the password for Deku.

Using the password that I got, I can easily log in to Duke using ssh.

  ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

  we have got our first flag




  ## Privilege Escalation ##

i am going to keep this straight forward.Inthe shell access i found that deku was only allowed restricted access
he could only access /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh and it is a form

   ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

Deku can give feedback. Let‚Äôs try to give malicious feedback. The malicious feedback is ‚ÄòDeku ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL ¬ª /etc/sudoers‚Äô

 ![nmap1 Screenshot](./Screenshot%20(147).png)

It works and now I got the root access.
